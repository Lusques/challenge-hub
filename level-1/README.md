# Vue.js Task 1 - Creating a Basic Component

### ðŸ“Œ Overview
This branch contains the first task of the Vue.js learning journey, where a basic Vue component was created and integrated into the main application.

### ðŸš€ Features
- **Vue project setup** using Vue CLI.
- **Component creation** (`AppComponent.vue`).
- **Data rendering** inside the template using Vue's `data()` function and props.
- **Component integration** into the main `App.vue` file.
- **Basic styling** using scoped SCSS.

### ðŸ”§ How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run serve
   ```
3. Open the browser at `http://localhost:8080/` to see the component in action.

### ðŸ“Œ Key Learning Points
- Understanding the **basic structure** of a Vue component.
- Using `data()` to define reactive properties.
- Importing and using a component in `App.vue`.
- Implement **props** to make the component dynamic.
- Applying **scoped styles** to a component.
- Improve styling with SCSS.

### âœ… Next Steps
- Explore component communication.
- Learn about Vue directives like `v-if`, `v-for`, and `v-bind`.

- Start using Vue Router for basic navigation.
- Learn about computed properties and watchers to handle complex logic.
